                                                    Abstract: This paper analyzes the relationship between the 
                                                    Major League Baseball amateur draft and team winning percentages 
                                                    from 2005 to 2018. To test the statistical significance of the 
                                                    amateur draft, I performed a two-stage least squared regression 
                                                    analysis that models the impact that draft success and payroll 
                                                    have on winning percentages. Understanding that drafting ability 
                                                    is not quantifiable, I use modern scouting theories to develop my 
                                                    first stage regressions and predict the rate at which teams find 
                                                    undervalued players. The second stage regressions formally test 
                                                    whether consistent draft success or free agency has a more 
                                                    statistically significant effect on winning. Even with significant 
                                                    investments in scouting and player development, this study refutes 
                                                    the theory that the amateur draft significantly impacts competitive 
                                                    balance.
