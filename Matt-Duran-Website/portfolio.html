                                          Draft or Free Agency?</a>

                                                Abstract: This paper analyzes the relationship between the 
                                                Major League Baseball amateur draft and team winning percentages 
                                                from 2005 to 2018. The MLB is considered a free agency dominated 
                                                league, and studies have proven that the voluntary movement of 
                                                players has altered competitive balance. Large market teams exert 
                                                financial pressure on smaller market teams by buying away their 
                                                best players. To counteract this effect, the league instituted 
                                                the amateur draft to balance the playing field, affording small 
                                                market teams the ability to acquire better players on favorable 
                                                terms. However, success rates of finding impactful players through 
                                                the draft are low. To test the statistical significance of the 
                                                amateur draft, I performed a two-stage least squared regression 
                                                analysis that models the impact that draft success and payroll 
                                                have on winning percentages. Understanding that drafting ability 
                                                is not quantifiable, I use modern scouting theories to develop my 
                                                first stage regressions and predict the rate at which teams find 
                                                undervalued players. The second stage regressions formally test 
                                                whether consistent draft success or free agency has a more 
                                                statistically significant effect on winning. Even with significant 
                                                investments in scouting and player development, this study refutes 
                                                the theory that the amateur draft significantly impacts competitive 
                                                balance.
