								stills or live clips that they have created using gallery mode developer tools.

								Gaming studios have developed advanced screen capture functionality and gallery modes that allow 
								the gamer to screenshot in game moments. These features have evolved to the point where 
								gamers are a burgeoning content creation market. 
								
								By putting this power into the hands of the user, gamers can push the 
								limits of the game’s intended use to create "new media art" and share their in game achievements. 
								As the market for this content grows, there will need to be a place where you store, refine 
								and share your content.

					      <ul>
					      	<li>Using Python Sockets API, wrote an application layer program that provided reliable file transfers over
						    unreliable data channels.
						<li>Implemented TCP reliability over UDP Socket API and simulated unreliable noisy transfer mediums using 
						    an emulator that simulated packet loss, corruption, delay, and more. In short, I implemented all facets of 
						    TCP protocol from packet timers, in-order delivery, checksum, and more while using UDP sockets for transport.
						</li>
						<li>Developed my own packet wrapper API, which serialized and deserialized data to be sent over the internet
						    via the emulator proxy program.</li>
						<li>This project was a good simulation for how we can implement reliability at the application layer while utilizing
						    noisy and unreliable data channels at the transport layer. This feature allows higher layers in the protocol stack
						    at the end host to be more complex, thus relieving pressure placed on core network hardware 
						    (routers and switches).

                                          Draft or Free Agency?</a>
                                          <ul>

                                                    Abstract: This paper analyzes the relationship between the 
                                                    Major League Baseball amateur draft and team winning percentages 
                                                    from 2005 to 2018. To test the statistical significance of the 
                                                    amateur draft, I performed a two-stage least squared regression 
                                                    analysis that models the impact that draft success and payroll 
                                                    have on winning percentages. Understanding that drafting ability 
                                                    is not quantifiable, I use modern scouting theories to develop my 
                                                    first stage regressions and predict the rate at which teams find 
                                                    undervalued players. The second stage regressions formally test 
                                                    whether consistent draft success or free agency has a more 
                                                    statistically significant effect on winning. Even with significant 
                                                    investments in scouting and player development, this study refutes 
                                                    the theory that the amateur draft significantly impacts competitive 
                                                    balance.
