Sharing a perfect blog to help you to host a static website using AWS S3, Route 53, ACM & Cloudfront victoria.dev/blog/hosting-yâ€¦ Kudos to @victoriadotdev I was struggling to do this as all articles were drafted in different pieces, but your blog helped a lot!

	* Hosting a static website...
	* buying and registering a domain name
	* navigating AWS S3, Route 53, Cloudfront to actually configure the server host. Redirections of clients to the correct places and more
	* ensure that all of the connections were secure.
	* learned about logging traffic
	* developing a favicon.ico
	* setting up buckets for content.
	* setting up redirects
	* setting up error messages
	* this began by developing on my columbia cunix account, then I ended up learning about amazon AWS and their hosting services.
