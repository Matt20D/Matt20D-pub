                        <p>
                            <u>"Computers aren’t the thing. They’re the thing that gets us 
                            to the thing." -- Joe MacMillan, <i>Halt and Catch Fire</i></u>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My name is Matthew Duran, and I am a second year Computer Science Master’s 
                            student at Columbia University. I am completing the Software Systems track, 
                            and through coursework and work experience I have garnered an appreciation 
                            for the precision required to engineer backend systems. While software is 
                            ingrained in every facet our daily lives, it is a powerful utility used by 
                            many to get to where they actually want to go. This fact is one of the reasons 
                            I am interested in full-stack development. This role offers me the ability to 
                            see projects go full circle, from engaging with lower level code that operates 
                            hardware to designing interfaces that bridge the gap between the underlying 
                            infrastructure and users. Whether the users are banking online or playing video 
                            games, it is great to see people leverage the power of modern computers 
                            through software.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I am a passionate, diligent, and curious developer. I don’t just stop with the 
                            first solution, but I iterate until an elegant solution is reached.
